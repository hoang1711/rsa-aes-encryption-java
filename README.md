## RSA Workflow

1. Generate two prime numbers `p` and `q`
2. Compute:
   ```text
   n = p × q
   φ(n) = (p − 1)(q − 1)
   ```

3. Choose public key `e`

4. Compute private key `d`

5. Encrypt:
   ```text
   C = M^e mod n
   ```

6. Decrypt:
   ```text
   M = C^d mod n
   ```

## AES Workflow

Implemented AES components include:

- SubBytes
- ShiftRows
- MixColumns
- AddRoundKey
- Key Expansion

This project manually implements AES logic instead of using built-in cryptography libraries.

---

## GUI Overview

The application includes a Java Swing GUI that allows users to:

- Enter plaintext
- Encrypt messages
- Decrypt ciphertext
- Load/save files
- Interact with RSA and AES functions visually

## Educational Objectives

This project was developed for learning purposes in:
- Information Security
- Cryptography fundamentals
- RSA algorithm
- AES algorithm
- Java GUI programming

---

## Limitations

- Educational implementation only
- Small RSA key size
- No OAEP/PKCS#1 padding
- Not suitable for production security systems

---

## Future Improvements

- Increase RSA key size
- Add UTF-8 support
- Implement secure padding
- Improve GUI design
- Add file encryption support
- Refactor code structure
